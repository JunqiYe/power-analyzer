# power analyzer
## Background
This project was inspired by [GPLama's cycling analysis video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWEffJrPJ1w). In the video, he used a website called [DC Rainmaker](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/analyzer#) to analyze the [fit files](https://developer.garmin.com/fit/overview/). The website costs quite a bit of money, and frankly, I thought I could do something like this with python and plotting library.

## Example

## Future Works
I'm planning on using a different plotting library to improve the interactability and aesthetic. The library I'm going to use is [ploty](https://plotly.com/python/). I will also build a front-end to host the application online. Additionally, I will add functionality for analyzing the data.
